# UFOs

## Overview

### Overview of Project

In this module, we built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We will also created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it reacts to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. We customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

### How to search !

Once a client reaches the website, he will see the image below:

The information from our data file can be filtered based on five different filters which include the date, city, state, country & shape. The data can be filtered on different levels once a category is filtered or selected. The information from the data file is then displayed in the table as seen below.

You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

## Summary

### Drawbacks and Developments

In conclusion, one drawback for this new design is that the filters do not account for different formatting adjustments such as dates, capital letters and spaces at the beginning or end of the filter. In regards to further developments, a date range filter might be a better filter than just a date when searching for these events. Another development is to apply capital letters when necessary in the City, State and Country columns.
